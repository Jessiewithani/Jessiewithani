#### Now that we have an understanding of what modus operandi means, what is my M.O. you ask? The art of imitation. I am a visual learner, and I learn efficiently through seeing then doing. Over the years, I've grown quite the passion for recreating/creating designs that are provided to me via the product and design teams. Not only do I enjoy the process of building such amazing features, but I find it so satisfying when I match it to the tee! I take pride in having immensely meticulous eyes, and care for my work whole-heartedly.

#### I'm always curious, a great team-player, a hard working individual, and a great problem solver. Don't believe me? See what the "critics" have to say!

#### "Jessie's superpowers are her attention to detail in ensuring what she builds perfectly matches designs, and her tenacity in exploring underspecified aspects of features and components to make sure that there are no unintended behaviors that cause bad user experience." - Matt Brown (CTO of JKBX)
