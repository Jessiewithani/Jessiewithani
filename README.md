#### Now that we have an understanding of what modus operandi means, what is my M.O. you ask? The art of imitation. I am a visual learner, and I learn efficiently through seeing than doing. Over the years, I've grown quite the passion for building user interfaces. Not only do I enjoy the process of creating such amazing features, but I find it so satisfying when I match it to the tee! I take pride in having immensely meticulous eyes, and care for my work whole-heartedly.

#### I'm always curious, a great team-player, a hard working individual, and a great problem solver.
